This repository represents the final project for the Probability Computiation, Stochastic Processes and Stochastic Modeling course. It constitutes an image search engine, which uses GLCM and SIFT features and different clustering algorithms in order to give the user 5 images, similar to the input one, from the COREL database. A project report was also realised, in the style of an IEEE article.
